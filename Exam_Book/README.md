Books
=====

Develop a system that assists Professors building their text books,
adding chapters containing either theory or exercise and checking the
coherence of the final result.

All classes must be inside the package `it.polito.oop.book`. The *facade
class* is `Book` --- all operations can be performed through it.

The class `TestApp` in the default package contains some drivers to help
testing the application.

The JDK documentation is accessible from the URL
<http://oop.polito.it/api/index.html>.


R1: Topics
----------

A `Topic` can be one of the topics of a theory chapter or the single
topic of a question. A topic is defined by its keyword - which is
unique.

The factory method `getTopic(String keyword)` in `Book` returns the
`Topic` associated to the given keyword. It either creates a new topic,
if it does not exist yet, or retrieves an existing one, if it has
already been created. The method accepts the keyword as single argument
and throws the exception `BookException` if the keyword is `null` or
empty. The method `getKeyword()` in *Topic* returns the keyword, and the
same is also returned by the `toString()` method.

A topic can have other topics as sub-topics. The method
`addSubTopic(Topic)` accepts a *Topic* as an argument and adds it as
sub-topic; it returns `true` if the subtopic was added or `false` if the
subtopic was not added because already listed as a sub-topic. The method
`getSubTopics()` returns a `List<Topic>` of all direct subtopics sorted
alphabetically.


R2: Questions
-------------

For the different topics it is possible to define exercises.

A `Question` represents a multiple answer questions. It can be created
using the method `createQuestion(String,Topic)` that accepts the text of
the question and its main topic. Getters are available for both fields:
`getQuestion()`, `getMainTopic()`.

The method `toString()` returns the question text followed by the main
topic in parenthesis, e.g.
`â€œWhat is a functional interface? (Interface)"`.

The method `addAnswer(String,boolean)` of class *Question* accepts an
answer and a boolean value indicating whether the given answer is
correct for the specific question. The method `numAnswers()` returns the
total number of answers added for the question. The methods
`getCorrectAnswers()` and `getIncorrectAnswers()` return the set of
answers (`Set<String>`) that are respectively correct and not correct
for the question.


R3: Chapters
------------

There are two types of chapters: *theory* and *exercise*.

A theory chapter can be built using the method
`createTheoryChapter(String title, int numPages, String text)` that gets
the title of the chapter, the number of pages, and a string with all the
text of the chapter. The method returns a `TheoryChapter` object. Topics
may be added to the chapter using the method `addTopic(Topic)`; the
method adds the given topic to the chapter and, recursively, all its
subtopics, either directly or indirectly specified.

> For instance, if *Class* is a subtopic of *Java* and *Abstract Class*
> is a subtopic of *Class*, adding the topic *Java* to a chapter would
> add both *Class* and *Abstract Class*.

The class provides getter and setter for the text. The method
`getTopics()` returns all topics inserted by *addTopic()*, without
repetitions and sorted in alphabetical order.

An exercise chapter can be added to the book using the method
`createExerciseChapter(String title, int numPages)` that accepts the
title of the chapter and the number of pages. The method returns an
`ExerciseChapter` object. Questions may be added to it using the method
`addQuestion(Question)` that accepts a *Question*. The method
`getTopics()` returns all topics specified as main topic in the
questions, without repetitions and sorted in alphabetical order.

Both classes provide the getters and setters for both attributes title
and pages: `getTitle()`, `setTitle(String)`, `getNumPages()` and
`setNumPages(int)`.


R4: Statistics and Checks
-------------------------

The method `getAllTopics()` in *Book* returns a list of all topics
`List<Topic>` specified in the book chapters -- both theory and exercise
--; the list is sorted in alphabetical order and does not contains
duplicates.

The method `checkTopics` return `true` if all the topics specified in
all exercise chapters are contained in at least one theory chapter.

The method `questionOptions()` in *Book* returns a map having as key the
number of answers and as values the list of questions having that number
of answers.


R5: Assignment
--------------

An assignment represents the answers to a question provided by a
student.

The method `newAssignment(String, ExerciseChapter)` creates a new
assignment for the given student whose ID is provided as argument and
the given exercise chapter. It returns an `Assignment` object that
provides the getter methods for the two pieces of information.

The method `addResponse(Question, List<String>)` adds the response by
the student to the given question: the list contains the answers that
the student considers correct. The method returns the score achieved by
the student: the score is `(N - FP - FN)/N` where:

-   `N` is the number of total answers for the question,
-   `FP` is the number of answers provided by the student that are not
    correct for the question,
-   `FN` is the number of correct answers for the question that are not
    provided by the student.

> For instance, let us consider a question has answers `A` (wrong), `B`
> (wrong), `C` (correct), and `D` (correct); and a response containing
> answers `B` and `C`, we have: `N=4`, `FP=1` (since `B` is in the
> response but is not correct), `FN=1` (since `D` is correct but is not
> in the response), so the score would be `0.5`.

The method `totalScore()` returns the sum of the scores for all provided
responses.
